R and RStudio
=============

R is a high-level interpreted programming language used in many modules with a
statistical component. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE)
for R, providing editing, debugging and much more.

Note that it is not necessary to have RStudio in order to use R, 
but **RStudio is highly recommended**.

Also note that in most of the cases below (excluding the approach using 
Software Hub), R must be installed before trying to install RStudio.



Installing R and RStudio on Windows
-----------------------------------

Software Hub
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate to the `Software Hub <https://softwarehub.imperial.ac.uk/>`__, scroll
down to RStudio (or type it in the search box) and click `Launch`. The RStudio
on Software Hub also includes R so you don't need to install it separately.

Further information on using the Software Hub is available on the `Imperial ICT
Software Hub webpage <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/computers-printing/devices-and-software/get-software/software-hub/>`__.

Direct install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current version of R can be obtained from the `Comprehensive R Archive
Network Windows download page <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>`__. The click
on the latest release link (it will be called something like R-4.0.2.pkg, but
the version may be newer than that). Run the installer and accept all of the
default options.

RStudio can be installed from the `RStudio install page
<https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>`__. Usually the big
blue button will automatically detect the right version. Again, run the
installer and accept the default options.
