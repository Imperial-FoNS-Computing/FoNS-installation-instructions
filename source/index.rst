Many modules in the Faculty of Natural Sciences have a programming component,
and for some of these you may wish to or need to install and configure the
relevant software tools on your own computer. This website contains instructions
for the installation and configuration of several packages which are used across
many modules in the Faculty. Instructions are provided for Windows, Mac and
Linux computers. If you have a Chromebook then most of the software here is not
directly installable, but for most recent Chromebooks you can follow the
:ref:`instructions for activating Linux <linux-chrome>` to set up a Linux environment on your
computer into which you can install the required software.
