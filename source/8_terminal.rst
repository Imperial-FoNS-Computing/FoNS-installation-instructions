Opening a terminal
==================

A terminal is a text window which enables you to run programmes on your computer
by typing their name, often followed by various options, commands, or data file
names. The terminal is often also called the command line. It may also be
referred to by the specific name of the program which interprets the text
commands, such as Bash or Zsh. Full instructions on how to use the terminal are
beyond the scope of this document, but some of the installation and
configuration steps described here need to be run in a terminal so its important
that you at least know how to start one.

If you need to know more about how to use a command line terminal then you
should follow the `Software Carpentry tutorial on the Unix Shell <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_.

Windows
-------

Terminal programmes are less frequently used under Windows than under MacOS or
Linux. The main use of the terminal on Windows in these instructions is in
conjunction with :ref:`Git`, which installs its own Git Bash terminal. To run Git Bash
(once you have installed Git), simply press the Windows key and click on Git
Bash (which may be in a submenu).

MacOS
-----

The simplest way to open a terminal on MacOS is to press `âŒ˜ + space` to open
Spotlight Search and then type `terminal` in the search window.

Linux
-----

The terminal is such an intrinsic part of working with Linux that you probably
already know how to launch a terminal on your system. Depending on your
distribution and choice of graphical user interface, the terminal programme
might be called `terminal`, `gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, `xterm`, or possibly
something else.

If you're not sure how to launch a terminal, then here are a few ways to find it:

    1. On Ubuntu and, possibly, some other distributions, press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.
    2. Click on the terminal icon in the menu bar.
    3. Press the Windows key to bring up a menu. The terminal program might
       appear in the menu, or you can start typing `terminal` in the text box that
       appears.
